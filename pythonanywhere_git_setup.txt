# Quick Fix Commands for PythonAnywhere
# Copy and paste these commands one by one in PythonAnywhere console

# 1. Go to your mysite directory
cd /home/mathserr/mysite

# 2. Initialize Git (this fixes the "not a git repository" error)
git init

# 3. Add your GitHub repository as the remote source
git remote add origin https://github.com/mathserr/symptom-tracker.git

# 4. Fetch the repository data
git fetch origin

# 5. Set up the main branch
git branch -M main

# 6. Pull the latest code (this might overwrite existing files)
git pull origin main

# 7. Test that it works
echo "âœ… Git setup complete! Your directory is now synced with GitHub."

# Now you can use "git pull origin main" anytime to update!
